# BPlusTree
A B+ tree is an m-ary tree with a variable but often large number of children per node. A B+ tree consists of a root, internal nodes and leaves. The root may be either a leaf or a node with two or more children.\
The primary value of a B+ tree is in storing data for efficient retrieval in a block-oriented storage context â€” in particular, filesystems(In our repo, we use mmap.). This is primarily because unlike binary search trees, B+ trees have very high fanout (number of pointers to child nodes in a node, typically on the order of 100 or more), which reduces the number of I/O operations required to find an element in the tree.\
In theory, if the size of the index node in the B+ tree is close to the size of the disk block, a query operation needs to access the disk logb(N) times.
## Feature
  * Use mmap to read and write to disk.
  * Use LRU to cache mapped blocks.
